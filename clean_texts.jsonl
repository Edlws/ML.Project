Mattress and cover can be purchased separately.\nA Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed.\nCrafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda.\nThe timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component.\nThis piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations!\nCountry of Origin: India\nHardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below:\n- Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth;\n- Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately;\n- To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months.\n- Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer.\n- Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer\n- Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents.\n- Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur.\n- Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.\nMatches perfectly with:\nProduct Specs\nBox 1 (top) 220 x 90 x 13cm.

Charlie has always gone above and beyond with great customer service! We recommend them to all our friends. Just recently we needed an adjustable bed after my mom’s injury and we needed ASAP to be able to bring her mom from the hospital. As always Charlie made it happen! Great store and great employees!!!!\nCaryl H.\nI have shopped at Wayne’s Furniture for years and always had a Great experience. Charlie is the greatest salesman and very honest about his knowledge in furniture. When something goes wrong with the furniture like the switches on the couch or chair he always sends Mike who is very Knowledgeable and fixes it instead of buying new furniture. Charlie is trustworthy and makes sure his customers are happy with the service provided. GREAT job Charlie keep up the good work!!!!\nTammy B.\nI found there is a great reason why Wayne's Fine Furniture has been around for so long - it's their great knowledge of the furniture industry, ability to navigate the current logistical challenges, and awesome customer service that puts Wayne's above its competitors. Charlie was a true partner through the process, helping to troubleshoot when my furniture was held up in transit. I would definitely recommend Wayne's!!\nSusanne K.\nBy far one of the most positive experiences you can get at a furniture store, Charlie goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied even a year after the sale was done. That’s the type of service and commitment you just see less and less of these days. Would highly recommend for your next furniture purchase! Also the prices and quality are unmatched.\nNick K.\nMy husband and I bought our very first home a couple months back so we decided to furnish our new home. We shopped and shopped until we came across this mom and pop store Wayne’s Furniture. We went in and furnished the master bedroom as well as my youngest sons room. Charlie is great! Super customer friendly savvy, fast delivery. I LOVE my bed and anyone who tours my home comments on my bed! My sons first time in his own room and he was too excited to start decorating! Thanks again Wayne’s Furniture- check them out. 5/5 stars for me\nShaura H.\nI was first introduced to Wayne’s furniture by my brother. Who only makes recommendations if he knows the company or person is reputable. Needless to say, Charlie and his staff did not disappoint.

{"url": "https://www.gloster.com/en/products/materials/teak", "text": "Teak\nTeak is a close grained hardwood with a high natural oil content. This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow. These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour.\nINDOOR USE\nGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit.\nOUTDOOR USE\nGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour.\nAs with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface.\nBecause teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off.\nIf you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection.\nIf you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split.\nTo protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth."}

Give them the gift of choice with a Oak For Less® Furniture gift card.\nGift cards are delivered by email and contain instructions to redeem them at checkout. Our gift cards have no additional processing fees.\nHow quickly will I get my order? (production or lead time)\nAt Oak For Less® furniture, we offer furniture from many different builders. Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana. Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others. We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made.\nSince lead times can vary, we give an estimated range. These lead times are APPROXIMATE, they are NOT EXACT. Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders and/or shippers. These situations are beyond our control. By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is our best estimate. When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it.\nCurrent estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix.\nFor example, item FD-3051T has an \"FD-\" at the beginning of its item #. On our list below, FD- items have a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks. So item FD-3051T has a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks. Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it.\nIf your delivery location is outside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra to these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements. Also, if the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.\n| Prefix: | Approximate lead time: |\n| FA / FUS | * Call for current production time * |\n| FD | 10 - 14 weeks |\n| HM | contact us for stock availability |\n| IFD | contact us for stock availability |\n| OD | 6 - 8 weeks |\n| SA | 12 - 16 weeks |\n| SD | contact us for stock availability |\n| TM | 8 - 12 weeks |\nIf you don't see the prefix of your item # here, please call us at 480-962-9930 to ask about the current production time.\nNeed to expedite your order?\nWe're here to help. Call 480-962-9930 and we'll let you know if it is possible to get your order sooner. A few builders offer expediting for an extra charge.\nGood news! We now offer nation-wide delivery for most products (we have shipped all over the U.S. We do not currently have a shipper to do Alaska nor Hawaii, and do not have international shipping (sorry!). We work with different shippers and they each have their own designated delivery areas of the U.S. - some areas may not be available, so please contact us to inquire about delivery to your area.\nThe shopping cart will automatically calculate the type of delivery depending on the item(s) and delivery location. Or, if you would like a delivery quote, please email us at info@oakforless.com or call our store at phone number 480-962-9930 and include the items that you are interested in as well as the delivery city, state, and zip code and we will get you a delivery quote.\nDelivery services are made by experienced independent contractors. Delivery is available if the customer is located within designated delivery areas. Delivery contractors do their best to be careful when delivering furniture, but in the event damage occurs to walls, flooring, etc., the customer will take up any issues solely with the independent contractor.\nCustomers must have the room ready for the delivery when it is scheduled. Delivery does NOT include moving old furniture or electronic devices such as TVs or audio/video components. If you ask them to do extra work, they will charge extra.\nWith any delivery method, the customer is responsible for making sure that the items will fit through their hallways and into the room of choice. If the driver cannot easily deliver it to the room of choice (narrow hallways/tight turns/low ceilings/is asked to move other furniture) there will be additional cost that must be paid to the delivery service at the time of the delivery. Regardless if the furniture fits into the room of choice or does not, the customer is still responsible for paying the delivery fee, it is not refundable.\nIf the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.\nBlanket Wrap delivery (states outside of Arizona):\nBlanket Wrap delivery starts at $395 and goes up depending on the item(s) and delivery area. To be sure of the delivery cost for your area, please contact our store and ask for a precise delivery quote. Different blanket wrap delivery services serve different areas, so this delivery includes bringing the item(s) inside and either putting them in the first dry area (threshold delivery) or depending on the shipper for your area into the room of choice (1st floor only) - it depends on the service for your area.\nIf your delivery requires stairs or steps or an elevator, we need to know in advance at the time of order because some shippers will not do stairs. Stairs or elevators may require an additional charge, it all depends upon which shipper it is.\nIf you order a platform bed, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, and also includes up to 30 minutes of assembling the platform bed.\nIf you order a table, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, but it does not include assembly of the table. If you require table assembly, please contact us at the time of order because some shippers will not do assembly. This may require an additional charge, depending on the shipper.\nPlease note that Blanket Wrap delivery does NOT include attaching or reversing hardware or installing and arranging adjustable shelves inside of a bookcase or cabinet as this can be time consuming. It also does NOT include attaching a headboard to a customer's existing bedframe as the hole locations that need to be drilled into the headboard can vary depending on the existing bedframe.\nBlanket Wrap delivery outside of Arizona is a one or two person delivery. An adult must be at the residence to sign for and accept the item(s) in good condition.\nBasic delivery (within Arizona only):\nBasic delivery covers areas within Arizona only. Basic delivery within Arizona starts at $95 and goes up depending on the item(s), if set up is needed, and the delivery area. Basic delivery includes the following: Placement inside the home - first floor, no stairs. This is usually a one-person delivery - the customer may be asked to assist the driver. This delivery does not include unpacking, debris removal, assembly, nor set up. For delivery upstairs or downstairs or if you need set-up, please contact our store at phone number 480-962-9930 to ask for those delivery/set-up costs. An adult must be at the residence to sign for and accept the item(s) in good condition."}

The figuratively shaped lamp body is made of poly–resin material, that gives a smooth and transparent flow of light. The bulbs placed inside the horns add extra elements of soft, sparkling and translucent light effects to the lamp.\nThe inspiration behind the Moo lamp was found in northern Norway, –in the breathtaking scenery of Hamarøy, where both designers have summer houses. Here the moose is frequently seen passing close to the houses and even on the lawns.

{"url": "https://jubileefurniturelv.com/products/anette-modern-leather-bed", "text": "12 years ago my sweet darling Charlene left and took our seven kids with her, I was devastated to say the least.\nFast-forward 10 years of pain and no hope, little ol me happens to stumble upon this piece of art. This is the spark I needed to find joy in the little things in life once again.\nIt was like a switch was flipped overnight, I know longer mourned my past life with Charlene. I took this new spark as a sign to head down to the local tavern. There I met a kind man named Bill. He was wonderful and introduced me into the swingers scene. Within days I had compiled an exquisite roster of charming ladies, it seemed that this couch sure was a hit! The only downside was I struggled lasting a satisfactory time due to the dazzling purple eyes of the gorilla staring into mine.\nTo this day I continue to enjoy the comfort of these ladies on the couch, and as a plus the kids all love piling up on it for movie night when they come and visit!\nI did a lot of research on Jubilee leather sectionals over a year before I pulled the trigger and purchased one. I most worried about the build quality, comfort and possible shipping damage after reading some negative reviews online. With that being said. I received my Bewley white Italian leather sectional (in stock) exactly 30 days including the day I ordered it to the day it was delivered (NV to OH). The ONLY issue I had was the delivery people said they would deliver it between 8 AM to 12 PM and they did not deliver it until 4:40 PM. However, they did a great job bringing in the sectional pieces and were very courteous. Definitely make sure you pay extra to have them bring the pieces in. I unwrapped the pieces and put the pieces together by myself easily. There was no shipping damage. I could not find a single defect anywhere, it was perfect and I was blown away by the build quality and it being stunningly beautiful. It is more beautiful in person than in pictures or video. You will not find a sectional anywhere else like this modern style. This is a high quality sectional. As far as comfort, it is firm being brand new. On a scale of 0 to 10 in terms of comfort, I would say a 5. However, I expected that from reading the reviews, they say the more it wears in over time the more comfortable it will get. It is not uncomfortable, just firm and when you adjust the headrest up it is more comfortable. The build quality is a 10. The white leather is not glove soft but a much more durable leather, so it should last long. Overall, I'm very pleased and get high praise from friends and family for its beauty and aesthetic appeal. I highly recommend this Jubilee Bewley leather sectional from my experience so far.\nI ordered the chair for me and john pork to chill but tim cheese came and took john pork, then bombardilo crocodilo flew and bombed the chair, my brother got stuck but tralalero tralala saved me and ran away to the forrest but brr brr patapim ran after me and i am stuck\nso i oredered him with pink fuz for the huzz but yesturday i caught my brother absolutley gooning on it so the gorrila was like heck no aliveanized himself and the roof went kaboomey i swear ro i need a refund and the companys being sued for killing my brother proffeser pork and damaging my 20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 dolar house and becasue my monkey is now gooning gone im so sad i think im gonna mew myself to sleep\nI had only intended to fetch a glass of water. A simple errand, driven by the parched desperation that accompanies a fitful night’s sleep. But what I found in the den on that wretched night has since clung to my mind like a cursed algorithm, looping endlessly in grotesque perpetuity.\nIt was the dead of night, the house swathed in the sort of silence that leaves one straining to hear the phantom chimes of non-existent Discord notifications. My descent down the staircase was cautious, each step cushioned by the thin veneer of carpet laid bare from years of neglect.\nThe den should have been empty. I should have been greeted only by the cold glow of the television, left on by some act of absentmindedness. But as I drew closer, I became aware of a sound—low, guttural, and punctuated by words strung together like errant memes vomited forth from a corrupted AI.\n“Bingus… Bingus… the drip immaculate…”\nMy father’s voice. But not his voice. No, it was distorted—laced with a mania so profound that I scarcely recognized it. I rounded the corner, throat clenched tight with a horror I could scarcely comprehend.\nAnd there he sat. Skeet Johnson, my father. Perched upon that damned Gorilla Chair as if it were some foul throne of delirium.\nIts form was meant to mimic a silverback gorilla, molded in the act of a triumphant roar. But to my eyes, it appeared as a beast of torment, its exaggerated musculature cradling my father in an embrace far too intimate. The arms of the chair wrapped around him like a lover’s desperate grasp, locking him in a ritual of depravity I could not fathom.\n“Father?” I croaked, my voice feeble. He scarcely reacted, his eyes glued to some unseen reverie like a YouTube reaction channel feeding on endless, vapid content.\n“Caught slippin’, eh, son?” he cackled, the sound unnatural and jagged. “This… this is the true grindset. The ultimate rizz.”\n“What are you talking about?” I whispered, clutching my own arms as if to ward off the chill seeping into my bones. “You look… mad.”\n“Madness?” he laughed, a laugh so discordant and vile it reminded me of a bass-boosted meme blasted through cheap Bluetooth speakers. “No, son. This is the drip. The forbidden sauce. The way Baby Gronk rizzed up Livvy Dunne, but, like, on a spiritual plane. I’m edging on enlightenment itself.”\nI stood there, paralyzed, the raw stench of vape clouds and Taco Bell Baja Blast clinging to the air. His eyes were wild, his pupils swollen to inky chasms that swallowed all traces of reason.\n“Father, you’ve lost yourself!” I screamed, though my voice cracked like a low-quality Vine snippet dredged from the depths of some forgotten meme archive.\n“I’ve ascended, boy,” he ranted, his hands grasping the gorilla’s foam-muscled arms as though drawing sustenance from them. “The Gorilla Chair, it’s a lifestyle. A state of mind. The primal Goon.”\n“No… no, this is madness!” I stumbled backward, desperate to flee. My father’s twisted form remained hunched upon the throne, eyes glazed and mouth agape with a joy so monstrous it twisted my stomach into knots.\n“Go on, Skid. Run,” he sneered, his voice already fading into a deranged mumble. “But know this—the Gorilla Chair calls to us all. It’s inevitable.”\nI bolted from the den, abandoning my quest for water. Instead, I sought refuge beneath my covers, the darkness of my room a fragile sanctuary against the madness that had overtaken my father.\nEven now, weeks later, I hear him at night—rambling from the den, his words incomprehensible yet threaded with that same sickly cadence of obsession. And I fear, deep down, that his prophecy may be true.\nFor sometimes, in the shadows of my dreams, I can feel it. The cold, terrible lure of the Gorilla Chair."}

{"url": "https://mahliainteriors.com.au/collections/mothers-day-15-off-sale/products/bone-inlay-floral-box-black", "text": "Inlay Handmade Pieces\nAs with all things made by hand, these pieces are all unique and small flaws may be present, which adds to the intrinsic character and beauty of each piece.\nCare Instructions\nTo clean your bone inlay or mother of pearl inlay furniture, please wipe with a slightly damp cloth. After some time of owning your inlay piece, if the shine comes off slightly then please apply a small amount of coconut oil and white wax and clean it with a dry cloth.\nBone and mother of pearl inlay furniture has a porous surface, so items in high-use situations - such as coffee tables - should be sealed prior to use. Grout or polyurethane sealant (available from any hardware store) is suitable for this - example: https://www.bunnings.com.au/cabot-s-500ml-satin-water-based-cabothane-clear-polyurethane-varnish_p1522368\nWhilst this sealant is clear, when you are sealing your piece, we recommend using a very soft cloth in a circular motion (rather than a paint brush) in order to avoid any potential brush strokes left on your piece.\nPlease do not use regular cleaning products (surface cleaners, glass cleaners) to care for bone inlay. They are very harsh to use on inlay pieces.\nIf your piece is under direct and constant sunlight, the bone pieces may have the potential to turn a slightly yellow tone over time, and little exposure to sunlight can be useful to help them stay light for a longer duration. Please be careful that you don't put your inlay piece under extreme heat or directly under the sun.\nIf your inlay products may be used often (tray, drawers for example), the bone pieces may fall from edges during the use. The wood and bone both are naturally contracting and expanding materials but not at the same pace, so during season/weather change this could happen. Please use all-fix or super glue available locally to easily fix yourself if this may happen.\nFor our vase products, we would recommend covering your vase base prior to using, as these vases are not 100% waterproof."}

Regular vacuuming is recommended without the use of beater bars to avoid threads being pulled. Spills should be absorbed with a dry cloth, then spot cleaned with mild soap and water. It’s normal for loose ends to show up from time to time with any area rug, however it’s important to snip them with a scissor immediately - pulling on loose ends by hand is harmful to the strength of your rug. Rug tolerances can vary by +/- 3 inches in relation to the advertised size. A non-skid pad is recommended to prevent slippage. Since rugs are rolled for shipping, occasionally they may crease during transit. All creases will disappear within 2 weeks after the rug is laid out flat. Reverse rolling will help flatten out creases promptly.\nCollection: Jasmine\nDesign: JAS-200A\nStyle: Modern & Abstract\nPattern: Wavy\nColors: Gray/Black/Ivory/Cream\nConstruction: Machine Woven\nMaterial: 100% Polypropylene\nBacking: Plain\nPile Type: Medium\nPile Height: 0.45\"\nUse: Indoor\nOrigin: Turkey"}

{"url": "https://woodshopfogoisland.ca/products/bertha-chair", "text": "Solid. A dependable character of the highest sorts, the namesake of the Bertha chair is Bertha Wilson. The name came out of a conversation that the designer, Donna Wilson, had with Zita Cobb, founder of our parent charity, Shorefast. “When she found out that I was Scottish and my last name was Wilson, she shared a story about the only other Scottish woman whom she had ever met who went by the name of Wilson – Bertha Wilson. A woman of modest means, she became the first female appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It seemed like a fitting name for such a humble and modern chair.”\nThe Bertha Chair is inspired by the vintage barrel chairs that were constructed from unused flour barrels. These chairs embody the outport attitude of finding new life for discarded or unused materials. Pair the Bertha Chair with a Pouffe to kick back and enjoy the view.\nMade using regionally sourced birch by our craftspeople at Fogo Island Workshops. Available in a range of finishes including hand-buffed Danish Oil, which deepens the amber colour of the wood, and White Oil, which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look. Both absorb into the wood and richen the grain. A variety of coloured lacquers are available. Custom colours and sizing are available on request.\nThe cushions and matching pouffe can be upholstered in either Kvadrat Divina upholstery or the iconic Shingle-Shangle pattern, inspired by the hand-carved shingles on historic Brett House in Joe Batt’s Arm. Both are 100% wool that is ethically and sustainably sourced, naturally stain resistant, and comes with life-long durability rating of 45,000 Martindale rub tests.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

On the flip side, are you looking for something more subtle? The Linea also comes in all-natural oak or all-black oak for those who prefer their drama with a side of calm. Either way, your space is about to get a whole lot more interesting!\nDimensions:\nThe Timber\nWood displays different grain patterns depending on which way they are cut - for example, the 'medullary ray' which can appear on oak furniture is a mark of good quality timber, these are just characteristics of the natural beauty of the wood. Wood veneers also allow distinctive patterns to be created on some surfaces, such as table tops and drawer fronts by the way slivers are arranged. All timber and veneer surfaces will change colour and mellow over time. New furniture will initially vary in shade from items that have been previously purchased.\nFreight Prices\nBelow is the typical freight price to large towns and Cities in NZ except rural.\n- All North Island including Auckland deliveries - $145\n- Wellington - free pick-up, (choose \"EMAIL bestfurniture@xtra.co.nz FOR A SHIPPING QUOTE\" at checkout).\n- Christchurch - $60 (or free pick-up)\n- South Island Cities or large towns - $75\nThis should come up at check-out, but if your address doesn't please email us on team@bestfurniture.co.nz and we will get you a quote."}
